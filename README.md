This repository contains:
1. Verilog/SystemVerilog RTL models of TON Coin miner (you can synthesize for different FPGA's or ASIC's);
2. Project with BitStream for Xilinx Kintex-7 325T FPGA;
3. CLI tools for Windows OS. This tools receives from TON Coin GIVER tasks and sends via UART/COM-port interface this tasks to FPGA miner;
4. Windows GUI for automatic mining process where you can create several mining processes for several FPGA's.
